### 1. **As a Developer, I want to optimize the web scraping process to ensure data is collected efficiently.**

- **Description:** Improve the efficiency of the web scraping process to reduce the time and computational resources required for data collection.
- **Priority:** High
- **Assumptions & Validation:**
  - The current scraping process takes too long and consumes too many resources.
  - Validation can be done through performance monitoring tools and benchmarks.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Analyze the current scraping script for performance bottlenecks.
  2. Refactor the scraping logic to improve speed.
  3. Test the updated scraping process with large datasets to measure efficiency improvements.
- **Actionability:** This can be assigned to a developer specializing in data scraping and performance optimization.

### 2. **As a Data Scientist, I need to ensure that the data collected is balanced and free from biases.**

- **Description:** Implement methods to detect and correct biases in the scraped training data, ensuring balanced representation.
- **Priority:** High
- **Assumptions & Validation:**
  - The data may be imbalanced, leading to biased AI models.
  - Validation will involve analyzing data distribution and identifying underrepresented categories.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Develop algorithms to assess the balance of the dataset.
  2. Apply techniques like oversampling or undersampling to correct data imbalances.
  3. Continuously monitor and adjust data balance during scraping.
- **Actionability:** The data science team can take charge of creating and applying bias detection methods.
